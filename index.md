### 5. rename file to be file2.md & try to link again
1. find the github doc to rename a file - google
"How do I rename a file in GitHub?
In your repository, browse to the file you want to rename. In the upper right corner of the file view, click to open the file editor. In the filename field, change the name of the file to the new filename you want. You can also update the contents of your file at the same time." 
  - [Renaming a file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/renaming-a-file)

### 4. Link from here to new file 
- [Here's my initial fuess to link to file2 == https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/file2 ](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/file2)
  - I wonder if the code iwll be processed by jeckyll?
  1. my guess was wrong it should have been [https://joecodeswell.github.io/file2/](https://joecodeswell.github.io/file2/)
  2. **RESULT == NG**  naving to above yields 404  File not found
  3. N.B. this link os GOOD ['https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/index.html'](https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/index.html)

### 3. Make a new file
1. Click at top to nav 
  - **AWAY FROM:** [JoeCodeswell / codenotes / index.me](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md)
  - **TO:**        [JoeCodeswell / codenotes](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/tree/gh-pages)
2. select gh-pages branch
3. click green [add file] button
  - I named the file 'file2'
    - should have been 'file2.md'?? 

### 2. Creation notes
- [This page link == ' https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/ '](https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/)
- this page says "codenotes / index.md in gh-pages"
- i think mandj is in main 
- i think i chose main at the time of creation for this in [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
I think the order of the stuff i did was:
1. [GitHib.com >> JoeCodeswell >> repositories](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell?tab=repositories)  
    - [New Repository]
    - fill it all in to make the repo
2. follow [Creating your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
  1. IMMEDIATELY follow [Decide which publishing source you want to use. For more information, see "About GitHub Pages."]
    - ["About GitHub Pages." >> Publishing sources for GitHub Pages sites >> ](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)
      - [see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site."](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

## 1. Original Stuff
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

- List

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
