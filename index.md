## Joe says, "Welcome to JoeCodeswell's  Code Notes on GitHub Pages

### creation notes
- this page says "codenotes / index.md in gh-pages"
- i think mandj is in main 
- i think i chose main at the time of creation for this in [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
I think the order of the stuff i did was:
1. [GitHib.com >> JoeCodeswell >> repositories](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell?tab=repositories)  
    - [New Repository]
    - fill it all in to make the repo
2. follow [Creating your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
  1. IMMEDIATELY follow [Decide which publishing source you want to use. For more information, see "About GitHub Pages."]

## Original stuff
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
