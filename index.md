### 4. Link from here to new file 
- [Here's my initial fuess to link to file2 == https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/file2 ](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/file2)
-   I wonder if the code iwll be processed by jeckyll?
### 3. Make a new file
1. Click at top to nav 
  - **AWAY FROM:** [JoeCodeswell / codenotes / index.me](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md)
  - **TO:**        [JoeCodeswell / codenotes](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/tree/gh-pages)
2. select gh-pages branch
3. click green [add file] button
  - I named the file 'file2'
    - should have been 'file2.md'?? 

### 2. Creation notes
- [This page link == ' https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/ '](https://joecodeswell.github.io/codenotes/)
- this page says "codenotes / index.md in gh-pages"
- i think mandj is in main 
- i think i chose main at the time of creation for this in [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
I think the order of the stuff i did was:
1. [GitHib.com >> JoeCodeswell >> repositories](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell?tab=repositories)  
    - [New Repository]
    - fill it all in to make the repo
2. follow [Creating your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
  1. IMMEDIATELY follow [Decide which publishing source you want to use. For more information, see "About GitHub Pages."]
    - ["About GitHub Pages." >> Publishing sources for GitHub Pages sites >> ](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)
      - [see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site."](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

## 1. Original Stuff
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JoeCodeswell/codenotes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
